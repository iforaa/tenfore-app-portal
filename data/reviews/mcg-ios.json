That feature alone is worth its weight in gold.  Gone.  You can no longer purchase the discount packages on the app.  There’s a “store” but good luck finding anything in there.  Blank white page.  Gone.  Golf is already hard enough.  Finding tee times can be a trial of patience and persistence.  You can no longer add a golfer and have them email a confirmation to  your playing partners.
